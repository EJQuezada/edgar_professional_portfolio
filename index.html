                    <h1>Greetings! My name is Edgar</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer with a "can do" attitude living in Berlin, Germany who is self-motivated, proactive, and constantly learning new skills.  As a result of my previous career in the legal industry, I pay great attention to details and find comfort in problem-solving which is why I decided to further myself by learning the necessary skills to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. For purposes of growth and to solidify skills acquired during my preparation as a Web Developer, I continue to learn new techniques, tools and programing languages. I looking forward to joining a company as their new and promising junior web developer. <br />

                            </div>
                            <p>I completed a 12-month part-time Full-Stack Web Development program with CareerFoundry GmbH where I received regular feedback from my personal tutor and mentor. In addition to my course, I built a <a href="#chatapp"> Native Chat App</a>, as well as a <a href="#myFlix">Full-Stack Project</a> using the MERN stack. While implementing what I learned during the course, I continously tested and cleaned my code in order to reduce errors in it.  Recently became a certified Ruby developer and am currently adding Golang to my technical skills to become a more versatile developer. </p>

                            <p>After completion of the C1 level course in German, I turned my attention into learning how to code and into becoming a reliable web developer. It has always been rewarding to me to work on intellectually challenging tasks and to learn about new technologies that I can use in my personal and professional life. It brought great pleasure to put lines of code together like puzzle pieces and end up with the "picture" that I had been envisioning. Best part is that if I am not entirely happy with what I have created, I can edit it make it better. I have the knowledge, ability and power to create wonderful applications and websites for people and organizations. </p>

                            <p>I have always enjoyed working with others to achieve a goal. Thus, after 20+ years of working in the legal field as part of litigation teams, I am turning my attention towards my true passion. I am looking forward to collaborating with teams to create wonderful fully-functional applications while keeping an open-mind, remaining curious, and most of all putting my creativity to work by writing code.</p>

As a lifelong problem-solver, I am always looking for best possible solution to challenges. While working as a legal professional I learned a great deal about digitization of documents for accessibility and simplification of discovery processes. During this time, the spark ignited in me to learn how to create and improve digital tools for everyday use. When I moved to Berlin I knew I had to consider switching careers as most of my credentials were non-transferrable. It was at this time that I saw the opportunity to follow my true-calling and become a Full-Stack Web Developer. </p>

I also find pleasure in watching movies, shows, or documentaries with my family. </p>

                        <h3 class="project-title">myFlix Movie Application</h3>
                        <p>It is a web application that provides users with access to information about movies, directors, genres, and release date. Users are able to register, update personal data, and create a list of favorite movies based on what is available in the database. The MERN stack was used to develop the server-side and the client-side.</p>
                        <div class="read-more-myflix">
                            <h4>Server-Side Technical Info</h4>
                            <p>
                                Using Node.js and Express, I created a RESTful API that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). The API is accessible via HTTP methods like GET or POST. CRUD methods are used in order to retrieve data from and store data into the movie database. The API provides movie information in JSON format.
                                <br />
                            </p>
                            <p>In order to test the API, I made use of Postman. Moreover, I included user authentication and authorization code in the form of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.</p>
                            <h4>Client-Side Technical Info</h4>
                            <p>Once the API was built, I began to build the interfact that users would need when interacting with the server-side. It is a responsive application developed using React and React-Redux. It provides several views, including a main view which shows a list of all the movies in the database, single movie view which allows users to add it to their favorites list, a login view, a registration view, and a profile view where registered users are able to update their information and list of favorites.</p>
                            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>This was a challenging project given the combination of different tools and technologies, but it has been my favorite project of the course so far. I have enjoyed using the Terminal while building the API and working with database structures. While developing the client-side, React and Redux worked to produce the outcome I desired for this project. With the guidance of my mentor and tutor, we overcame some technology limitations from my 4+ years-old laptop.</p>

                        <p>A chat application for use with mobile devices. Using the chat interface, users are able to send/receive text messages, images, and share their location.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Technical Info</h4>
                            <p>The application was built using React Native. In order to monitor the development of this application, I used Expo.io and Android Studio. The application was optimized to function both on Android and iOS devices. Using Gifted Chat library, I created the interface and functionality of the application.</p>
                            <p>
                                In order to store the messages, I the Google Firestore Database. For image storing, I used Google's Firebase Cloud Storage. Moreover, in order for chat conversations to be accessible when offline, I implemented asyncStorage to store the messages locally. In order to authenticate users anonymously, I used Google Firebase authentication.<br />
                            </p>
                        <h4>Error Handling</h4>
                            <p>While building the application, I ran into some version compatibility issues with my development equipment and the packages or dependencies used to develop the application. However, I adjusted the Node versions, re-installed Expo Go, and toggled some settings in order to get my application to run as expected and stable. </p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>In building the Chat Application, I completed the final project required in my full-stack development course. Aside from the technical difficulties arising from compatibility issues, I realized that my problem solving skills had developed to the point of spotting some bugs before it was too late and resolved compatibility issues. </p>

                            <p>It is a serverless progressive web application (PWA) that was built using React and a test-driven development (TDD) approach. </p>
        
                        <h4> Technical Info </h4>
                            <p>The application uses an API to fetch upcoming event for selected cities, uses OAuth2 authentication flow. The app uses AWS Lambda for the authorization server. Also, using the OOP approach, user alerts are created. </p>
                            <p>Given the use of a service worker, the app works also while offline. Application uses tokens for authorization and access of Google Calendar API. </p>
                            <p>Moreover, in order to visualize data, I used the Recharts library to create a scatter-plot graph and a pie-chart for events fitting the search criteria. </p>
                        <h4> Conclusion </h4>
                            <p>While building the Meet Application, I learned quickly how to utilize the google-calendar API to generate a sample of events that could be sorted by types of event and event location. </p>

                        <h4>Technical Info</h4>
                            <p>Portfolio website is built using pure HTML, CSS (flexbox, grid, etc.) and a sprinkle of JavaScript to enable hamburger menu toggling and buttons to function. Moreover, the CSS code in this project utilizes native variable for repetitive values. </p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>Created a web-based portfolio to showcase some of my projects and provide an insight of my capabilities and potential to become a great web developer. </p>

                            <p>One of my first applications that I built from scratch to showcase a sampling of Pokemon characters via Modals that appear after a character box is selected. </p>
                        <h4>Technical Info</h4>
                            <p>Using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, and the Bootstrap framework, I built a small web application that allows users to browse a sample of Pokemons loaded from an external API. The Modal displays some information about the selected Pokemon including its name. Finally, I formatted the code in the application to comply with ESLint.</p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                            <p>In building this web-based application I learned a great deal about using APIs to make a less bulky application because it uses data that is stored online so that the application is able to load faster and be more stable. </p>

                            <p>I built a simple, yet classic, application that generates a list of items on a user's 'To-Do' list.  The user is able to modify the 'To-Do' list by clicking on a button to add a new task to the list, and/or remove tasks from the list by clicking on the 'X' to mark item as a completed task. </p>
                        <h4>Technical Info </h4>
                            <p>The application uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery to create a simple interactive task application. </p>
                        <h4> Conclusion </h4>
                            <p>Built the application to learn to utilize jQuery to quickly and easily code simple JS applications.</p>
