## Portfolio Website

A responsive one-page website to showcase my professional web development portfolio which I built following a mobile-first approach. It is built mostly with pure HTML and CSS, and some Javascript was included to allow toggling of the hamburger menu on mobile screens and for the functionallity of "Read more / Read less" buttons. The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values. A postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
