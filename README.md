# Web Developer Portfolio Site

I have created a responsive one-page site to showcase my professional portfolio for job seeking purposes. It was designed keeping in mind a "mobile-first" approach as most users are likely to visit it using a mobile device. 

My site was built with using mostly HTML, CSS for styling purposes, and some snippets of Javascript to toggle the hamburger menu on mobile screens, and to facilitate the functionallity of the "Read more / Read less" buttons. The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values. Moreover, a postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
