## Portfolio Website

A responsive one-page website to showcase my professional web development portfolio which I built following a mobile-first approach. It is built with pure HTML, CSS and some Javascript to allow togglin of the hamburger menu on mobile screens and for the functionallity of "Read more / Read less" buttons. The CSS code uses native variables for repetitive values. A postprocessor was used to improve browser support.
